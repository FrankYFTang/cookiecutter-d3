Start by launching the webserver with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and hack away!

If you're hip and running `python3`, that would be `python3 -m http.server`.
Or if you have `node` installed, their `http-server` is more stable under many requests in my experience (but generally, not necessary).

A few steps (using Homebrew) to get a server that way:

```
brew install npm
npm install -g http-server
```
